In grad school, there was a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy of a "key to stats tests" that was passed on from one generation of grad students to the next when the "younger" students were taking biostatistics. 
It was a simplified version of the key that is on the inside cover of Biometry by Sokal and Rohlf, the required text for the course until recent years.
It was an especially handy reference to have during the open-book portions of the exams, where we were expected to decide on the best analysis for a particular dataset and question. 
Since then, I've found myself going back to that key, or searching out similar ones, to refresh my memory when someone asks for advise on their analyses. Today I found a very cool version of such a key on the UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education site (which has a wealth of knowledge for stats of all sorts).
