## DUE: 2018-04-18

By this time in the semester, you should have a good idea of what you are focusing on for your project.
The **Methods Description** document should be a short (400 - 500 words) description of the analysis methods you intend to employ in your project.
For example, if you are carrying out a systematic review, you should describe what a systematic review is, how you will be carrying out your specific review (e.g., keyword search terms, which search engine, etc.), some anticipated inclusion/exclusion criteria, etc..
If you are analyzing a data set that either you collected, or that you acquired, you should try your best to identify what type of analysis is best to use to answer your questions - e.g., t-tests, linear regression, ANOVA, etc.. 
Please keep in mind that I am fully aware that we haven't covered all of the analyses you might use in class yet. 
Try your best, using the texts provided, but know that this document is a way for me to provide you with feedback and guidance on the final project analysis.
