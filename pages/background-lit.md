## DUE: 2018-03-28

Continuing to work on your Semester Project, I would like you to submit the results of a background literature search as an [annotated bibliography](http://users.clas.ufl.edu/msscha/ThesisCSS/thesis_ab.html).
For this assignment, I expect to see 10 to 15 references to peer reviewed journal articles or peer reviewed book chapters. 
You can certainly include more than 10 to 15 refs if you'd like.
You need to rely on peer reviewed literature.
A ***very*** small number of references to high quality websites, reports, or books are okay, but most of your sources should be journal articles.

I will be paying particular attention to what you write about how a given reference fits within your project. 
This is a very important part of your written description (though it need not be long). 
In some cases, you will not have access to the article.
Glean what you can from the abstract, and then we'll go through how to use the [Pace Inter-Library Loan](http://libguides.pace.edu/interlibrary_loan_and_connectny) system.
