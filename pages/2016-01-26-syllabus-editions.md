title: New additions to the syllabus
---

I've added links to lecture notes and assignments to the **Course schedule** section of the [syllabus](http://mlammens.github.io/Biostats/syllabus/).
Note that the **Lecture notes** are material I prepared and used to guide the class, but I may have changed the order of presentation or used different specific examples. The **In class R file** is the file I created while working through the material during class.
Problem set 1 will **not** be due next week, but rather on 2/8, since we did not cover all of the material you'll need to successfully complete the problems.
