title: Hints and ideas for problem set 3
---

A key piece of problem set 3 is successfully making a function to generate samples from the *t*-distribution.
As I pointed out in the assignment, Logan pp. 34-35 offers a good explination of how to write a function.
Here I'm going to give you an example of a function that calculates the **standard error of the mean**, which is one piece of the function required to complete the assignment.

We can make a new, custom function using the `function` command in R.
Our function should take in some inputs and return our desired output.
In our case, we want our function to take in three inputs, $(\mu,\sigma,n)$, and return the standard error of our sample.

Recall that the standard error of the mean is:

$$
s_{\bar{y}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$


```r
## Initiate the function
std_error <- function(mu, sigma, n){
  
  ## 1. Draw n samples from a normal distn with mu and sigma
  n_samps <- rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  
  ## 2. Calculate the standard deviation of the sample
  sd_samps <- sd(n_samps)
  
  ## 3. Calculate the standard error of the mean
  se_mean <- sd_samps / sqrt(n)
  
  ## Return this value
  return(se_mean)
  
}
```

When you excute this chunk of code, you might think nothing has happened.
But if you look at your `Environment` you will see that `std_error` is now a defined function.

Now try using this new function.


```r
std_error(mu = 0, sigma = 1, n = 100)
```

```
## [1] 0.09141835
```

What is returned is a single value for the **standard error of the mean** based on a sample of 100 draws from a standard normal distribution.
If I wanted 10,000 values of standard error using the function, I could put it in a `for` loop from `1:10000`.
