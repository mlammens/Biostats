# Introduction to Linear Models

## Statistical Models

From Logan, p. 151:

> A **statistical model** is an expression that attempts to explain patterns in the observed values of a *response variable* by relating the response variable to a set of *predictor variables* and parameters.

A generic model looks like:

response variable = model + error

### Simple linear model

$$
y = bx + a
$$

where $b$ is the slope and $a$ is the y-intercept.
