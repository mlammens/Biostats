# Non-parametric tests

Let's say our data don't fit the assumptions of the *t* test. What are our options?

## Rank based tests - Mann-Whitney test

Look at ranks, rather than actualy values.

## Randomization tests

Let's look at a dataset from Logan. 

```{r}
lizard <- read.csv(file = "https://mlammens.github.io/Biostats/data/Logan_Examples/Chapter6/Data/beetle.csv")

library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(data = lizard, aes(x = SIZE, y = BEETLES) ) +
  theme_bw()
  
```

#### Major Challenge

1. Calculate the *t*-statistic for differences in number of beetles consumed the two size classes of lizards.
2. Randomize/ shuffle the data.
3. Calculate the **new** *t*-statistic. Repeat this 999 times.
4. How does the observed *t*-stat compare to the generated *t*-stats?
