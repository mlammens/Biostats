### How likely is my bag of M&Ms?

Write a short R script to simulate the combinations of colors that would have been possible from your bag of M&Ms assuming the company-stated color distribution (24% blue, 14% brown, 16% green, 20% orange, 13% red, 14% yellow) and use this script to calculate the probability of obtaining the combination in your bag. 

Needed:
* `for` loop
* `if` statement
* `sample` function

```{r}
# Let each color be represented by a number
colors<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
# Here's what my bag looked like
mycount<-c(5,6,5,9,21,12)
# Company probabilities
probs<-c(.14,.14,.16,.13,.20,.24)
# Set up a counter and start it at 0
count<-0
replications<-3000

for(i in 1:replications){
  probsample<-sample(colors,58,replace=TRUE,probs)
  probsamplevector<-c(as.numeric(sum(probsample==1)),as.numeric(sum(probsample==2)),
                      as.numeric(sum(probsample==3)),as.numeric(sum(probsample==4)),
                      as.numeric(sum(probsample==5)),as.numeric(sum(probsample==6)))
  if(identical(mycount,probsamplevector)=="TRUE"){
    count<-count+1
    }
  }
  probability<-count/replications
probability
```
