* [Datasets for Quinn and Keough text](http://qkstats.com/data-files/) - You can download all of the datasets used in Quinn and Keough as a zip file. For those students in one of my courses in which this is a required text, I recommend you put the unzipped folder into your `data` sub-folder.

* [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - A site filled with great tutorials on basic and advanced stats methods in R. Also has good plotting resources.

* [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) - Another great site for all things R. Especially good resource for making `ggplot2` plots.
