title: Hints and ideas for problem set 1
---

Here are some tips for problem set 1:

* We learned about `for` loops in the last class. You *can* simulate the battle between an red fox and arctic fox using a `for` loop, **but** using a `while` loop will be more efficient. Here is a good site for information on how to setup a `while` loop:

* I strongly suggest that you start by simulating the outcome of a single bout between an arctic and red fox, given that the red fox attacks first. Look at how often the red fox wins versus loses.

* Next simulate a bout when the red fox is on the defensive. How often does the red fox win?

* As your loop progresses, you will need a way to track who won the previous match. This will help you determine if the red fox is attacking or defending in the current bout.
