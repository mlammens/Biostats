title: Hints and ideas for problem set 1
---

Here are some tips for problem set 1:

* We learned about `for` loops in the last class. You *can* simulate the battle between an red fox and arctic fox using a `for` loop, **but** using a `while` loop will be more efficient. Here is a good site for information on how to setup a `while` loop: 
[http://www.programiz.com/r-programming/while-loop](http://www.programiz.com/r-programming/while-loop)

* I strongly suggest that you start by simulating the outcome of a single bout between an arctic and red fox, given that the red fox attacks first. Look at how often the red fox wins versus loses.

* Next simulate a bout when the red fox is on the defensive. How often does the red fox win?

* As your loop progresses, you will need a way to track who won the previous match. This will help you determine if the red fox is attacking or defending in the current bout.

* **UPDATE 2016-02-03** The idea of using a `while` loop comes from the fact that your simulation should last until a particular criteria is met, specifically until either the the red fox or arctic fox has won 21 bouts. Remember, it's the first animal to 21 wins that wins overall. If you use the `while` loop, you shouldn't need a `for` loop at all. You will need some indicator of how many bouts have been won by each animal.
