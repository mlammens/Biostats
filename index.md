## Course Description

This course covers issues related to the proper manner in which develop and conduct a research project. Statistical issues related to environmental evaluations will be discussed, including minimal detectable levels, proper sample size, and determination of proper methods for evaluation of data, using both parametric and nonparametric procedures.

## Semester Project Overview

During the semester, you will carry out an independent research and analysis project, using the skills we learn in this class. 
The project represents 40% of your grade, but is broken up into several components. 

* [Research question exercise](pages/research-question-exercise.html) - 5% - DUE 2/14
* [Background literature search](pages/background-lit.html) - 5% - DUE 3/28
* Methods description - 5% - DUE 4/18
* Mini-presentation (5 minutes in class) - 5% - DUE 4/18, 4/25, or 5/2
* Final report - 20% - DUE 5/9


## Resources

Here are some useful resources for leanring R, biostats, research methods, and grants.

### R

* [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - A site filled with great tutorials on basic and advanced stats methods in R. Also has good plotting resources.

* [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) - Another great site for all things R. Especially good resource for making `ggplot2` plots.

### Biostats

* [Diagram of distribution relationships](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/distribution_chart/) - Here's a good site outlining the different relationships between various statistical distributions. It's based on a well known 
[paper](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/2008amstat.pdf) by Leemis and McQueston.

### Grants

* [Barnabas McHenry Hudson River Valley Awards](https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/funds/mchenry)

* [Torrey Botanical Society Andrew M. Greller Graduate Student Research Award for Conservation of Local Flora and Ecosystems](http://www.torreybotanical.org/grants-awards/torrey-botanical-society-andrew-m-greller-graduate-student-research-award-for-conservation-of-local-flora-and-ecosystems/)

* [Environmental Consortium of Colleges and University- Hudson Valley Specific](http://environmentalconsortium.org/resources/scholarships/scholarships.html)

* [Hudson River Environmental Society - McKeon Research Grant Application](http://www.hres.org/joomla/images/mckeon_research_grant_application_2018.pdf)
