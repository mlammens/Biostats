## Course Description

This course covers issues related to the proper manner in which develop and conduct a research project. Statistical issues related to environmental evaluations will be discussed, including minimal detectable levels, proper sample size, and determination of proper methods for evaluation of data, using both parametric and nonparametric procedures.

## Resources

Here are some useful resources for leanring R and biostats.

* [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net/) - A site filled with great tutorials on basic and advanced stats methods in R. Also has good plotting resources.

* [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) - Another great site for all things R. Especially good resource for making `ggplot2` plots.

* [Diagram of distribution relationships](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/distribution_chart/) - Here's a good site outlining the different relationships between various statistical distributions. It's based on a well known 
[paper](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/2008amstat.pdf) by Leemis and McQueston.
