Problem Set 3: Probability Distributions
========================================================

**Suggested submission: Feb, 29 2016**

## Part 1

Write a function in R that:

1. draws a sample ${X_1,X_2,…,X_{n}}$ of size $n$ from the normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2 )$ (you are free to choose $\mu$ and $\sigma^2 \gt 0$), 
2. calculates the standard error of the mean, and 
3. calculates 

$$
\frac{ \bar{X} - \mu }{ s.e.mean }
$$

This function should have three inputs $(\mu,\sigma^2,n)$ and 
one output, the value of $\frac{ \bar{X} - \mu }{ s.e.mean }$

**NB:** See Logan pp. 34-35 for an explination of how to write your own function.

Your function takes samples from the t-distribution. 
Draw a large number (10,000 is probably fine, but you can play around with it) of samples from this distribution for $n = 5$, $n =50$, and $n =500$. 
(Remember, $n$ is the number of draws from the normal distribution used to draw one sample from the t-distribution.) 
Plot these three histograms, preferably using `ggplot2` so that each histogram is on the same plot.
(You could also use the `hist` function with the option `add = T`, which will allow you to plot them all on the same plot).

## Part 2

Using 1000 random draws from the t-distribution (you can use your function or R’s built-in function here) and the Normal distribution, plot the QQ plot comparing them for $n = 5$, $n =50$, and $n =500$. 
(Hint: Use the function `qqplot` and see Logan p. 118.) 
For easy comparison, put all three scatterplots on the same plot, using different colors to distinguish the three cases.
