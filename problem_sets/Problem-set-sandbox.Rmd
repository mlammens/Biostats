*Caveat - this example is based on a real competative relationship, but all numbers are completely fictional.*

Red fox and arctic fox compete both directly and indirectly where their species ranges meet. 
Direct competition usually involves fighting between individuals, while indirect competition usually involves competition for denning locations.
Generally, red fox can out compete arctic fox in both direct and indirect competition, but cannot physically tolerate the colder temperatures that arctic fox can.
Therefore, the red fox is primarily responsible for the southern range edge of the arctic fox.

During direct competition, an individual will "attack" as long as it has the "advantage" in the fight.
The individual maintains the "advantage" as long as it is "wins" a bout. 
If on the other hand, an individual is attacked, it will "defend".
An individual "wins-overall" when it scores 21 "wins" on its opponent. 
(This setup is similar to how raquetball is scored.)
If a red fox attacks first, it will "win" a "bout" with a probability of 0.6. 
If a red fox is attacked by an arctic fox, it will "win" the "bout" with a probability of of 0.5. 

Estimate, by simulation, the probability that during a red fox-arctic fox interaction, **a red fox will "win-overall"**.

# Part 1

Use the `iris` dataset that comes with R to answer the following questions.
We worked with this dataset in class during **Week 2**.
As a reminder, you can 'load' the `iris` dataset using the following command:

```
data(iris)
```

1. Calculate the **mean**, **standard deviation**, and an additional **measure of location** and **measuer of dispersion and variability** of your choosing for **Petal Length** for the full `iris` dataset **AND** for each species separately. 
In words, describe the differences you observe between species, and between individual species and the full dataset. 
Be sure to identify which measures of your choosing you are calculating. 
You may want to consult *Logan; Table 3.3* when deciding on additional measures.
**(5 pnts)**

2. Construct a **boxplot** for **Petal Length** using the `iris` dataset. 
Both the *Logan* and *Quinn & Keough* texts provide extensive information on boxplots.
You can use `base` R or `ggplot2`. 
See [this site](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_distributions_(ggplot2)/) for a good outline of constructing a boxplot with `ggplot2`.
In your plot, each box should represent a different species.
Describe each component of a generic boxplot, and describe why we might be interested in each value that is represented.
**(10 pnts)**

* **BONUS** Construct separate **density histograms** for **Petal Length** for each species. 
Overlay on top of the histograms curves for the **normal distributions** with the means and standard deviations calculated in (1) above. 
Hint 1: check out [this site](http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/probability.html) for information on plotting a normal distribution.
Hint 2: You can use `ggplot2` to overlay the normal onto your histogram, or in `base` R you can try adding `add = TRUE` to the `plot` function.
**(5 bonus pnts)**

# Part 2

* Recall the M&Ms we worked with in Week 1. 
Using the same logic we used to derive the **binomial distribution**, derive the probability of obtaining a given combination of colors in our bag.
([Hint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution)). 
Calculate the probability of getting your specific bag (our data are [here](http://mlammens.github.io/Biostats/data/class_mm_data.csv))
